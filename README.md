# stock_market_prediction / analysis
## Objective:
The project will explore the relationships within a focused dataset of market key performance indicators in order to establish a model to predict stock behaviour and potential price point of a given stock. By developing a thorough understanding of our chosen indicators we will deteremine their statistical signifiance in relation to market behaviour as well any correlations that may exist between these independant indicators.

## Methods of Communication and Conflict Resolution
Daily communication regarding general discussion and deliverable updates will take place in a private channel in Slack. Group members are expected to participate in an open dialogue to share ideas, concerns and status updates. Rough documents will be uploaded to Slack to for purposes of feedback and all approved raw data will be committed to the Resources folder  in the project repository for quick access. Once group members have completed a deliverable, it will be uploaded to the project repository on GitHub as a new branch where it will be reviewed and committed to the master branch accordingly.

In addition to attending the weekly sessions, additional video conferences may be held on Zoom/Google Meet on an as needed basis. The time and date of said sessions will be decided based on necesseity and group availability. All scheduling will be conducted via Slack to ensure complete transparency.

Conflict resolution will be decided by a majority rule. That said, all group members are expected to maintain an open mind and conduct themselves respecfully and for the purposes of the team objective. 

## Methodology:

### Purpose:
* The topic of a market analysis was selected by unanimous decision by the group due to a keen interest in developing a better understanding of market indicators and how they can be used to optimize investment.

#### Goals

* How can we define and use the correlation between our indicators to predict a stocks final price point?
* What indicators possess the greatest statistical significance?
* How much confidence can be placed in our chosen indicators?

### Data Sources
* By analyzing available stock market data and extrapolating perceived key performance indicators we will create a focused dataset specialized for our analysis. Initial data has been retrieved from records from the Federal Reserve. The group is also open to exploring additional datasets to strengthen the integrity and breadth of our existing database. Additional data may be added on an as needed basis or for the purposes of expanding on the initial analysis.
