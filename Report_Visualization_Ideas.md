# Report Ideas

Themes
* 
Vital few v/s trivial many
- Does the Pareto principle apply within the music industry
- What do the stats look like? What percentage of artists claim what percentage of revenue? Example - 5 percent of the artists claim 95% of the revenue
- What can be said about the reasons behind this behaviour - what creates the vital few? Can attributes from songs say anything about
- Is there a correlation between popularity and revenue
- Alternatively - the pareto principle could be examined with respect to the percentage of total songs v/s the popularity enjoyed
- Can revenue and popularity both be treated as zero-sum entities? Exclusivity should not be an issue here >> the same person could buy more than one record and also rate different songs as 5s or 4s.
- 
The core idea of the project is to investigate whether a disparity exists and if so, what factors influence it
* What percentage of the total artists get above 90 on the popularity scale

# Narrative and Talking Points
Intro - Data exploration through a Visual means to seek out insights not afforded by ML modeling

D1 - 
* Bulk of artists concentrated in the mid range of popularity with very few in 80+ category
* Shape of data is interesting and seems to be positioned in multiple layers of normal distributions
* ? Total number of unique tracks
* ? Total number of unique artists
* Upper Quartile @ 60
* Lower Quartile @ 27
* Include a view of percentiles on the same visual - or include summary statistics

D2 - 
* Comparing how popularity relates between Tracks and Artists
* Data seems to corrleate well for the most part of the range except at the end of the range
* The edge of the data tells a few different tales
* Highly Popular artists can have tracks that are lower in popularity
* The reverse is however not true. There are no Highly popular tracks where the artist is rated lower
* Seemingly suggests that an artist with one or few high popularity tracks will continue to drive high popularity despite lower rated future performances (read as tracks)
* Once you get popular, it tends to stick regardless of performance levels - that is precisely what the top row suggests
Future Tasks:
- Test Hypothesis for the statement
- Find data showing popularity of a given artist over time and associated track popularity as well

D3 -
* Mid range of the data tends to show some correlation and dependence between parameters
* The given 4 parameters do not suggest anything about data above 80 (track popularity) after which point the randomness seems to manifest more so

D4 - 
* First Track above 80 (1965) / Earliest Track above 80 is from 1965
* First Track above 90 (2013) / Earliest Track above 90 is from 2013
* Bottom row insights:
* Artists from the 30s, 40s and 50s claim about 30 despite unpopular tracks
* Contemporary artists claim about 55 despite unpopular tracks
* An artist from 1944 has popularity rating of 79 despite track rating 33

D5 - 
* Trying to explore the interactions between features which could potentially 
* No significant interaction witnessed
